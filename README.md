## Description
This project is a part of my education to become a full stack developer. It is for showcasing my skills and knowledge. 

Looking for a project to put together all the skills I have learned so far, I found a course on Udemy called [Build Facebook clone with REACT JS AND THE MERN STACK 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-facebook-clone-and-master-react-js-mern-stack-2022/). It ticked many boxes, e.g. Redux, MongoDb, Express, React, Node, and more. However, I quickly came to the relization that it was lacking in quality. The code was far from DRY, technologies not up-to-date, and the project was not well structured. Instead of ditching the project I set out to do it my own way with better structure, newer technologies, and a more DRY approach.


## Usage
There are two choices for usage: 
1. **Go to the website and peak around.**
   1. Log in with the dummy user Michal Scott: 
   Email: thatswhat@shesaid.com Password: 1234.
   2. Or create a user with your own or a [throw-away email].(https://temp-mail.org/en/)
2. **Clone the project to your machine. NB: You will need to clone both the front-end and back-end repos** 
   Prerequisites for option 2:
   - Node.js v15.x or higher.
   - Fill out .env.sample with your own credentials. You will need:
     - A Mongodb database.
     - A Google Cloud Platform account.
     - A Cloudinary account.

    Then run In both repos.
